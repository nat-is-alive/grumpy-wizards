The Tale of the Wicked Wizard Malwareus and the Valiant Knight Sir Scriptalot

In the mystical Kingdom of Syntaxia, there lived an evil wizard named Malwareus. His dark powers were feared by all, but his most notorious creation was a sinister poison. This poison, when applied to strings of text, caused them to mutate in chaotic ways. Malwareus delighted in the confusion his poisons sowed across the kingdom, causing residents to be unable to read anything at all!

However, hope was not lost. A valiant knight named Sir Scriptalot had been tirelessly working in his lab, concocting an antidote potion to reverse the wizard's foul work. Sir Scriptalot's dedication and brilliance were the kingdom's last defense against the wickedness of Malwareus.

Game Instructions
This game requires two players who will take on the roles of Malwareus and Sir Scriptalot, respectively. The players will be engaged in a pair programming exercise where they create functions in different programming languages.

Player One: Malwareus (Evil Wizard)
Malwareus must implement a poison() function in any programming language. This function takes a string and a number and outputs a corrupted string by altering every other nth character in turn. The first nth character should be capitalized and wrapped in hyphens -, and every other should be not capitalized but wrapped in asterisks \*.

Example:

poison("string", 3) => "st-R-in*G*"

Player Two: Sir Scriptalot (Valiant Knight)
Sir Scriptalot must implement a potion() function in a different programming language than Malwareus. This function takes the corrupted string and the number, returning it to its original form.

Example:

potion("st-R-in*G*", 3) => â€œst-R-in*G*"

Bonus Task
For a truly integrated experience, Malwareus and Sir Scriptalot can work together to make their functions interoperable. This can be achieved through a shared database, text file, or an API endpoint.

If unable to find a second player, please still take part in this task, using two programming languages of your choice. Either ones you know or challenge yourself to learn something new!
